### Organized Poker + Quality of Life Improvements

![](/images/organized-poker-plus-qol-improvements.png)

Available [here on the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2066900717), based on the ["Poker Organized" mod by Andre](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260389703).

This mod adds four scripted buttons for common actions when playing Poker:
- dealing two cards to all players
- playing cards to the table
- resetting cards and shuffling the deck
- folding your hand

Additional changes:
- everyone gets a "Poker Hand Rankings" cheat sheet for players that are new to Poker
- fixed rotation of cards in the hands of "corner" players (thanks @kabinet_K for spotting the issue)
